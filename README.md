# IoT Smart Home Automation Simulation

This project simulates a basic IoT smart home system where a temperature sensor reading controls a fan. The simulation prints the sensor value and the corresponding device action (turning the fan on or off) every 5 seconds.

## Features
- Simulates temperature sensor readings.
- Controls a virtual device (fan) based on sensor thresholds.
- Provides a simple demonstration of real-time monitoring and control logic.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-smart-home.git
   cd iot-smart-home
